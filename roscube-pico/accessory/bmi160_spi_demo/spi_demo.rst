How to Make SPI Demo
####################

1. Introduction
---------------

This is a demo to show how to get the data of **BMI160** by **SPI ioctl** in **ROScube Pico**.

The data includes:

   * CHIP ID  
   * PMU STATUS
   * SENSOR DATA (ACCEL and GYRO).

.. note::
    
    In this BMI160 demo, by using ``/dev/spidev2.0``.

2. Build
--------

Download the code from Github `Adlink-ROS/bmi160_spi_demo  <https://github.com/Adlink-ROS/bmi160_spi_demo>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Adlink-ROS/bmi160_spi_demo.git
    cd bmi160_spi_demo

1. Usage
--------

Test the demo following the command.

i) Compile the code by gcc

.. code-block:: bash

    gcc -o bmi160_test main.c bmi160.c

ii) Run the code

.. code-block:: bash

    ./bmi160_test

iii) Result

    If successfully worked, it will show data:

    * CHIP ID: ``0xD1``
    * PMU STATUS: ``0x14``
    * SENSOR DATA: **50 points**
